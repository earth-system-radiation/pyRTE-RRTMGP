# pyRTE-RRTMGP

This is the repository for the pyRTE-RRTMGP project.

This project provides a **Python interface to the [RTE+RRTMGP](https://earth-system-radiation.github.io/rte-rrtmgp/)
Fortran software package**.

The RTE+RRTMGP package is a set of libraries for for computing radiative fluxes in
planetary atmospheres. RTE+RRTMGP is described in a
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001621) in
[Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems](http://james.agu.org/).
