    "# Longwave Radiative Transfer Example with PyRTE-RRTMGP\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the PyRTE-RRTMGP package to solve a longwave radiative transfer problem. PyRTE-RRTMGP is a Python implementation of the Radiative Transfer for Energetics (RTE).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRTE-RRTMGP provides a flexible and efficient framework for computing radiative fluxes in planetary atmospheres. This example specifically focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading gas optics data for longwave radiation\n",
    "2. Processing atmospheric data from the RFMIP (Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project)\n",
    "3. Computing gas optics properties\n",
    "4. Solving the radiative transfer equation to obtain upward and downward fluxes\n",
    "5. Validating results against reference solutions generated with the original RTE fortran code\n",
    "\n",
    "The package leverages xarray and dask for efficient data handling and parallel computation, making it suitable for large-scale atmospheric modeling applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gas Optics**: Handles spectral properties of atmospheric gases\n",
    "- **RTE Solver**: Computes radiative fluxes based on atmospheric properties\n",
    "- **Data Handling**: Uses xarray for labeled, multi-dimensional data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the workflow for longwave radiative transfer calculations, which are essential for understanding Earth's energy budget and climate modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [documentation](https://pyrte-rrtmgp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information."

This divides the dataset into chunks of 3 experiments each, allowing Dask to process these chunks in parallel. Chunking is a key Dask feature that enables parallel processing without loading the entire dataset into memory at once."
