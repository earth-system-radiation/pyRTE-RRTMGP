Here are two worked examples showing the calculation of fluxes from atmospheric state. The first 
demonstrate the calculation of clear-sky fluxes using conditions provided by the 
Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project as described in 
[doi:10.1029/2020JD033483](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033483). The second generates 
profiles in Radiative-Convective Equillibrium following 
[doi:10.5194/gmd-11-793-2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-793-2018). Clouds with fixed physical properties 
are introduced into 2/3 of the columns.
