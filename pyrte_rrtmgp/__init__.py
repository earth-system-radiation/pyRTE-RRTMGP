"""
pyRTE-RRTMGP: Python Interface to RTE+RRTMGP.

This package provides a Python interface to the RTE+RRTMGP Fortran software package,
which is a set of libraries for computing radiative fluxes in planetary atmospheres.

The package includes bindings for:
- RTE (Radiative Transfer Equation) solvers for shortwave and longwave radiation
- RRTMGP gas optics models
- Various utility functions for optical properties and flux calculations
