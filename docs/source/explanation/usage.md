# Basic Usage

This section provides a brief overview of how to use `pyrte_rrtmgp` with Python.

## RRTMGP and RTE

pyRTE-RRTMGP is a Python package that provides a Python interface to the [RTE-RRTMGP software](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp) (Fortran).

You can use this Python package to define a radiative transfer problem, compute gas and cloud optics, and solve the radiative transfer equations, using [RTE-RRTMGP](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp).


Specifically, this Python package contains tools for:

* RRTMGP (RRTM for General circulation model applicationsâ€”Parallel)
* RTE (Radiative Transfer for Energetics)

See the paper [Balancing Accuracy, Efficiency, and Flexibility in Radiation Calculations for Dynamical Models](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001621) for more details about the Fortran code.

## Defining and Solving Radiative Transfer Problems

A typical workflow with pyRTE-RRTMGP involves the following steps:

1. **Loading gas optics data using the `load_gas_optics` function**
    Gas data usually contains atmospheric profiles with various combinations of temperature, pressure, and gas concentrations. [what specifications do we expect the input data to conform to?]
2. **Loading cloud optics data using the `load_cloud_optics` function**
    [TBD] [what specifications do we expect the input data to conform to?]
3. **Define an atmosphere with the load_rrtmgp_file function**
    [TBD]
4. **Computing gas optics using the `compute_gas_optics` function**
    This function can handle two different types of problems: ``absorption`` (longwave) and ``two-stream`` (shortwave). It usually also uses a gas mapping dictionary to map gas names to their corresponding indices in the atmosphere data.
5. **Computing cloud optics using the `compute_cloud_optics` function**
    This function can handle two different types of problems: ``absorption`` (longwave) and ``two-stream`` (shortwave).
6. **Adding cloud optics to the gas optics using the `add_to` function**
    This function combines the gas and cloud optics to create a single set of optical properties for the atmosphere.
7. **Solving the radiative transfer equations using the `rte_solve` function**
    This function uses the optical properties of the atmosphere to solve the radiative transfer equations and compute the radiative fluxes [TBD anything other than fluxes?].
