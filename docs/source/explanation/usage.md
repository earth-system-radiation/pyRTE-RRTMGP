# Basic Usage

This section provides a brief overview of how to use `pyrte_rrtmgp` with Python.

## RRTMGP and RTE

pyRTE-RRTMGP is a Python package that provides a Python interface to the [RTE-RRTMGP software](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp) (Fortran).

You can use this Python package to define a radiative transfer problem, compute gas and cloud optics, and solve the radiative transfer equations, using [RTE-RRTMGP](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp).


Specifically, this Python package contains tools for:

* RRTMGP (RRTM for General circulation model applicationsâ€”Parallel)
* RTE (Radiative Transfer for Energetics)

See the paper [Balancing Accuracy, Efficiency, and Flexibility in Radiation Calculations for Dynamical Models](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001621) for more details about the Fortran code.

## Defining and Solving Radiative Transfer Problems

A typical workflow with pyRTE-RRTMGP consists of the following steps:

### 1. Loading gas optics data using the [load_gas_optics](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_gas_optics.load_gas_optics) function

Gas data usually contains atmospheric profiles with various combinations of temperature, pressure, and gas concentrations. See [](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_gas_optics.load_gas_optics) for more details.

### 2. Loading cloud optics data using the [load_cloud_optics](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_cloud_optics.load_cloud_optics) function

See [](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_cloud_optics.load_cloud_optics) for more details.

### 3. Define an atmosphere with the [load_rrtmgp_file](pyrte_rrtmgp.utils.load_rrtmgp_file) function

See [](pyrte_rrtmgp.utils.load_rrtmgp_file) for more details.

### 4. Computing gas optics using the [compute_gas_optics](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_gas_optics.GasOpticsAccessor) accessor

This function can handle two different types of problems: `absorption` (longwave) and `two-stream` (shortwave). It usually also uses a gas mapping dictionary to map gas names to their corresponding indices in the atmosphere data. See [](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_gas_optics.GasOpticsAccessor) for more details.

### 5. Computing cloud optics using the [compute_cloud_optics](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_cloud_optics.CloudOpticsAccessor) accessor

This function can handle two different types of problems: `absorption` (longwave) and `two-stream` (shortwave).

### 6. Adding cloud optics to the gas optics using the [add_to](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_cloud_optics.CombineOpticalPropsAccessor) accessor

This function combines the gas and cloud optics to create a single set of optical properties for the atmosphere. See [](pyrte_rrtmgp.rrtmgp_cloud_optics.CombineOpticalPropsAccessor) for more details.

### 7. Solving the radiative transfer equations using the [rte_solve](pyrte_rrtmgp.rte_solver.rte_solve) function

This function uses the optical properties of the atmosphere to solve the radiative transfer equations and compute the radiative fluxes. See [](pyrte_rrtmgp.rte_solver.rte_solve) for more details.
