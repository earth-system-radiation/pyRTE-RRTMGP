# Low-Level Interface

The `pyrte_rrtmgp.pyrte_rrtmgp` module provides a low-level interface to the RTE-RRTMGP and RRTMGP functions. It is generated by pybind11 from C headers of RTE-RRTMGP.

See the [RTE-RRTMGP repository on GitHub](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/pyRTE-RRTMGP) and the [RTE-RRTMGP documentation](https://earth-system-radiation.github.io/rte-rrtmgp/) for more information about these functions.
