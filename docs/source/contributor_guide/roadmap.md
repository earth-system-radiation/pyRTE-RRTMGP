# pyRTE-RRTMGP Roadmap

## Vision

pyRTE-RRTMGP is a Python package that provides a user-friendly interface to the algorithms implemented with the RTE-RRTMGP project.
It fits into the broader scientific Python ecosystem and is designed to be intuitive and easily extensible.

## Goals for Future Releases

- High-Level Python interface for all relevant RTE and RRTMGP functions
- Documentation for all functions, multiple usage examples
- Comprehensive test suite
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Support for Windows, macOS ARM, and other platforms
- Package installable via PyPI
- Support for vertical (GPU) and horizontal (parallelization, e.g. with Dask) scaling
